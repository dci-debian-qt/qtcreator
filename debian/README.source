This package is now under Debian's Qt/KDE maintainers umbrella.
As such we only keep debian/ under the VCS.

The upstream tarball ships minified JQuery which where replaced
with the latest, editing friendly version from Debian.

Files replaced were,

$ find -name jquery\*.js -print -exec cp /usr/share/javascript/jquery/jquery.js {} \;
./doc/titlecase/jquery.js
./src/shared/qbs/doc/templates/scripts/jquery.js
./tests/manual/appwizards/htmlimportscenario_01/jquery-1.5.min.js
